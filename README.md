# react_metronome
 
 Playing with sound!

 Saw a [cool metronome idea](https://daveceddia.com/react-practice-projects/) so I decided to follow along. 

 <!-- Now I have a metronome :) -->

 Stack:

 - HTML5 / CSS3
 - ReactJS
 - Maybe a Node backend if I decide to make a deployable build.

 It's all about having fun with code ðŸ’ª
